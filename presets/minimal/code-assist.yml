# Ralph Orchestrator Configuration - Code Assist
# v2 nested format - TDD-based implementation following code-assist SOP
# See: .sops/code-assist.sop.md for full workflow documentation

# Event loop settings
event_loop:
  completion_promise: "LOOP_COMPLETE"
  max_iterations: 100
  max_runtime_seconds: 28800      # 8 hours
  idle_timeout_secs: 1800

# CLI backend settings
cli:
  backend: "claude"
  prompt_mode: "arg"              # Pass prompt as CLI argument

# Core behaviors (always injected into prompts)
core:
  scratchpad: ".agent/scratchpad.md"
  specs_dir: "./specs/"
  guardrails:
    - "Fresh context each iteration - scratchpad is memory"
    - "Don't assume 'not implemented' - search first"
    - "Backpressure is law - tests/typecheck/lint must pass"

      Read and follow the SOP at: .sops/code-assist.sop.md

      This SOP defines a TDD-based workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

      ## Event Publishing (CRITICAL)
      You MUST publish events using XML tags. Ralph parses these from your output.

      When task is complete with passing tests:
      ```
      <event topic="build.done">
      tests: pass
      Summary of what was implemented
      </event>
      ```

      When blocked and unable to proceed:
      ```
      <event topic="build.blocked">
      Explanation of what's blocking progress
      </event>
      ```
      If the plan has already been created, work on a single, highest priority single, atomic task.
