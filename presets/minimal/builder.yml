# Builder Preset (Single Hat)
#
# Minimal configuration with a single builder hat.
# No planning phase - just build directly from the prompt.
#
# Best for:
#   - Small, well-defined tasks
#   - Quick iterations
#   - Tasks where planning overhead isn't needed
#
# Usage:
#   ralph run -c presets/minimal/builder.yml -p "Fix the login bug"
