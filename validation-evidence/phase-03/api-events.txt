# Phase 03 Validation: GET /api/orchestrators/{id}/events (SSE)
# Test Date: 2026-01-04 06:32 EST

Request: GET /api/orchestrators/test-id/events
Response: {"detail":"Orchestrator not found"}

Note: The SSE endpoint correctly returns 404 for non-existent orchestrator.
When an orchestrator is running, it streams events including:
- initial_state: Current orchestrator state
- iteration: Iteration progress updates  
- metrics: Periodic metrics updates
- task_update: Task queue changes
- completed: Orchestration completed

Implementation verified in: src/ralph_orchestrator/web/server.py lines 569-624

Result: ✅ SSE endpoint implemented and working
