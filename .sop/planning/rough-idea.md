# Rough Idea: ACP Support for Ralph Orchestrator

Add ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) support to Ralph Orchestrator, using xenodium/agent-shell as an example of how agent messages should be handled.

## Context

Ralph Orchestrator is a production-ready implementation of the Ralph Wiggum technique - putting AI agents in a loop until tasks complete. It currently supports Claude, Q Chat, and Gemini as adapters.

## Reference Implementation

- **xenodium/agent-shell**: Reference for how agent messages should be handled
