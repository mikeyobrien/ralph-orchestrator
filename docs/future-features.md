# Future Feature Ideas

Parked ideas - focusing on validation gates first.

## Real-Time Terminal User Interface (TUI)

A live terminal interface showing real-time progress while Ralph works:
- Iteration count, runtime, cost, context usage
- Activity feed of current files/tools being used
- Checkpoint history
- Interactive controls (pause, resume, stop)

Likely using Rich or Textual for implementation.

## Intelligent Project Onboarding

An onboarding system that:
- Analyzes project structure, config files, dependencies
- Detects frameworks, conventions, architecture patterns
- Generates tailored ralph.yml configuration
- Remembers project-specific context for future sessions
