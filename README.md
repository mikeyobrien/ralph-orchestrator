A hat-based orchestration framework that keeps Ralph in a loop until the task is done.

> "Me fail English? That's unpossible!" - Ralph Wiggum

**Alpha Notice:** Ralph Orchestrator is under active development. It works today, but expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases.

v1.0.0 was ralphed into existence with little oversight and guidance. v2.0.0 is a simpler, more-structured implementation. Looking for the old version? See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3).

## What is Ralph?

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) — autonomous task completion through continuous iteration.

> "The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Ralph is smart; let Ralph do the work."

### Two Modes of Operation

Ralph supports two orchestration styles:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Traditional** | Simple loop — Ralph iterates until done | Quick tasks, simple automation, minimal config |
| **Hat-Based** | Ralph can wear many hats — specialized personas coordinate through events | Complex workflows, multi-step processes, role separation |

**Traditional mode** is the original Ralph Wiggum approach: start a loop, let it run until it outputs the completion promise. No roles, no events, just iteration.

**Hat-based mode** adds structure: specialized personas coordinate through events. You define the roles that fit your workflow — reviewers, testers, documenters, whatever makes sense. Presets provide ready-made patterns like TDD or spec-driven development.

### The Ralph Tenets

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability** — Each iteration clears context. Re-read specs, plan, code every cycle.
2. **Backpressure Over Prescription** — Don't prescribe how; create gates that reject bad work.
3. **The Plan Is Disposable** — Regeneration costs one planning loop. Cheap.
4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory** — Files are the handoff mechanism.
5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts** — Add signs, not scripts.
6. **Let Ralph Ralph** — Sit *on* the loop, not *in* it.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full philosophy.

## Features

- **Multi-Backend Support** — Works with Claude Code, Kiro, Gemini CLI, Codex, Amp, Copilot CLI, and OpenCode
- **Hat System** — Specialized Ralph personas with distinct behaviors
- **Event-Driven Coordination** — Hats communicate through typed events with glob pattern matching
- **Backpressure Enforcement** — Gates that reject incomplete work (tests, lint, typecheck)
- **Presets Library** — 20+ pre-configured workflows for common development patterns
- **Interactive TUI** — Real-time terminal UI for monitoring Ralph's activity (experimental)
- **Session Recording** — Record and replay sessions for debugging and testing (experimental)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+
- At least one AI CLI:
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (recommended)
  - [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Amp](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp)
  - [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot) (`npm install -g @github/copilot`)
  - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`)

### Via npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli --version
```

### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install ralph-orchestrator
```

### Via Cargo

```bash
cargo install ralph-cli
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator.git
cd ralph-orchestrator
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"

# Or create symlink
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/ralph /usr/local/bin/ralph
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
ralph --version
ralph --help
```

### Migrating from v1 (Python)

If you have the old Python-based Ralph v1 installed, uninstall it first to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# If installed via pip
pip uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via pipx
pipx uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via uv
uv tool uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# Verify removal
which ralph  # Should return nothing or point to new Rust version
```

The v1 Python version is no longer maintained. See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3) for historical reference.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Traditional mode — simple loop, no hats (recommended for getting started)
ralph init --backend claude

# Hat-based mode — use a preset workflow with specialized personas
ralph init --preset tdd-red-green

# Combine preset with different backend
ralph init --preset spec-driven --backend kiro

# See all available presets
ralph init --list-presets
```

This creates `ralph.yml` in your current directory. Without a preset, you get traditional mode (no hats). With a preset, you get hat-based orchestration.

### 2. Define Your Task

**Option A:** Create a `PROMPT.md` file:

```bash
cat > PROMPT.md << 'EOF'
Build a REST API with the following endpoints:
- POST /users - Create a new user
- GET /users/:id - Get user by ID
- PUT /users/:id - Update user
- DELETE /users/:id - Delete user

Use Express.js with TypeScript. Include input validation
and proper error handling.
EOF
```

**Option B:** Pass inline prompt when running:

```bash
ralph run -p "Add input validation to the user API endpoints"
```

### 3. Run Ralph

```bash
# Autonomous mode (headless, default)
ralph run

# With inline prompt
ralph run -p "Implement the login endpoint with JWT authentication"

# Interactive TUI mode (experimental)
ralph run -i

# Resume interrupted session
ralph resume

# Dry run (show what would execute)
ralph run --dry-run
```

### Alternative: SOP-Driven Sessions

For standalone planning and task generation (without Ralph's event loop), use these commands:

```bash
# Start an interactive PDD planning session
ralph plan                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph plan "build a REST API"        # Provide idea inline
ralph plan --backend kiro "my idea"  # Use specific backend

# Generate code task files from descriptions
ralph task                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph task "add authentication"      # From description
ralph task specs/feature/plan.md     # From PDD plan file
```

These commands spawn an interactive AI session with bundled SOPs — perfect for one-off planning without configuring a full workflow.

## Configuration

Ralph uses a YAML configuration file (`ralph.yml` by default).

### Traditional Mode (No Hats)

The simplest configuration — just a loop that runs until completion:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Traditional mode
cli:
  backend: "claude"

event_loop:
  completion_promise: "LOOP_COMPLETE"
  max_iterations: 100
```

This runs Ralph in a loop. No hats, no events, no role switching. Ralph iterates until it outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE` or hits the iteration limit.

### Hat-Based Mode (Specialized Personas)

> Ralph can wear many hats.

Add a `hats` section to enable role-based orchestration. Hats subscribe to events (triggers) and publish events when done:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Hat-based mode (example structure)
cli:
  backend: "claude"

event_loop:
  completion_promise: "LOOP_COMPLETE"
  max_iterations: 100
  starting_event: "task.start"

hats:
  my_hat:
    name: "🎯 My Hat"
    triggers: ["task.start"]        # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: ["work.done"]        # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |
      Your instructions here...
```

With hats, Ralph publishes a starting event, which triggers the matching hat. That hat does its work and publishes an event, potentially triggering other hats. This event-driven handoff continues until completion.

> **Tip:** Use `ralph init --preset <name>` to get pre-configured hat workflows. See [Presets](#presets) for ready-made patterns like TDD, spec-driven development, and more.

### Full Configuration Reference

```yaml
# Event loop settings
event_loop:
  completion_promise: "LOOP_COMPLETE"  # Output that signals completion
  max_iterations: 100                   # Maximum orchestration loops
  max_runtime_seconds: 14400            # 4 hours max runtime
  idle_timeout_secs: 1800               # 30 min idle timeout
  starting_event: "task.start"          # First event published

# CLI backend settings
cli:
  backend: "claude"                     # claude, kiro, gemini, codex, amp, copilot, opencode, custom
  prompt_mode: "arg"                    # arg (CLI argument) or stdin
  experimental_tui: false               # Enable TUI mode support

# Core behaviors (always injected into prompts)
core:
  scratchpad: ".agent/scratchpad.md"    # Shared memory across iterations
  specs_dir: "./specs/"                 # Directory for specifications
  guardrails:                           # Rules injected into every prompt
    - "Fresh context each iteration - scratchpad is memory"
    - "Don't assume 'not implemented' - search first"
    - "Backpressure is law - tests/typecheck/lint must pass"

# Custom hats (omit to use default planner/builder)
hats:
  my_hat:
    name: "My Hat Name"                 # Display name
    triggers: ["some.event"]            # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: ["other.event"]          # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |                     # Prompt instructions
      What this hat should do...
```

## Key Concepts

### Hats

Hats are specialized Ralph personas. Each hat has:

- **Triggers**: Events that activate this hat
- **Publishes**: Events this hat can emit
- **Instructions**: Prompt injected when hat is active

View event history:

```bash
ralph events
```

### Scratchpad

All hats share `.agent/scratchpad.md` — persistent memory across iterations. This enables hats to build on previous work rather than starting fresh.

The scratchpad is the primary mechanism for:
- Task tracking (with `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[~]` markers)
- Context preservation between iterations
- Handoff between hats

### Backpressure

Ralph enforces quality gates through backpressure. When a builder publishes `build.done`, it must include evidence:

```
tests: pass, lint: pass, typecheck: pass
```

| `ralph-cli` | Binary entry point and CLI parsing |
| `ralph-bench` | Benchmarking harness (dev-only) |

## Building & Testing

### Build

```bash
cargo build           # Debug build
cargo build --release # Release build
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests (includes smoke tests with JSONL replay)
cargo test

# Run smoke tests specifically
cargo test -p ralph-core smoke_runner

# Run Kiro-specific smoke tests
cargo test -p ralph-core kiro
```

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests use recorded JSONL fixtures instead of live API calls — fast, free, and deterministic.

**Fixture locations:**
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/basic_session.jsonl` — Claude CLI session
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/kiro/` — Kiro CLI sessions

**Recording new fixtures:**

```bash
# Record a session
ralph run -c ralph.yml --record-session session.jsonl -p "your prompt"

# Or capture raw CLI output
claude -p "your prompt" 2>&1 | tee output.txt
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo fmt --check
```
