    title: "Why authenticity beats algorithm hacks every time"
    hook: "I watched hundreds of DJs chase viral moments. Only one strategy actually lasted."
    angle: "In electronic music, the influencers who build real careers ignore growth hacks and focus on genuine connection with their sound and audience"
    rationale: "Right now there's massive fatigue with algorithmic gaming and fake engagement. People are craving real voices, especially in creative spaces where authenticity is currency."

        feedback: "Strong hook with immediate credibility (hundreds of DJs = insider experience). Fits Myla's calm, reflective voice perfectly. Highly relevant to aspiring creators tired of growth hacks. Authentic to her 'values authenticity over hype' persona."
      - reviewer: "critic"
        score: 6.0
        feedback: "The 'authenticity beats hacks' message has been beaten to death in creator content. Hook is decent but the angle is painfully generic - 'genuine connection' is vague platitude territory. The rationale mentions 'authenticity is currency' which is ironic corporate-speak. Needs specific, actionable insight beyond the tired authenticity sermon."

    title: "Your niche isn't a genre - it's a perspective"
    hook: "Stop trying to be 'the melodic techno person.' That's not a niche, that's a category."
    angle: "The electronic music creators building real influence aren't defined by genre tags, but by their unique lens - like 'the one who explains why certain tracks hit different at 3am'"
    rationale: "The influencer space is oversaturated with people trying to own categories. The cultural shift is toward perspective and POV - what unique angle do YOU bring to existing conversations."

        feedback: "Hook grabs attention with direct command, but 'Stop trying' tone is slightly more aggressive than Myla's warm, understanding style. The 3am example is perfect and authentic. Strong relevance but needs softer delivery to match avatar."
      - reviewer: "critic"
        score: 7.5
        feedback: "The 'perspective not category' advice is solid and the 3am example is specific enough to work. Hook is punchy. But 'unique lens' and 'unique angle' are still buzzword territory - the idea gestures at specificity without fully committing. Would be stronger with a second concrete example instead of abstract 'what unique angle do YOU bring.'"

    title: "The festival green room taught me more than any growth course"
    hook: "Want to know the real difference between DJs with 10k followers who get booked and those with 100k who don't?"
    angle: "True influence in creative fields comes from peer respect and industry relationships, not just audience size - show your expertise to other creators, not just fans"
    rationale: "There's growing awareness that follower counts are vanity metrics. The conversation is shifting to 'who actually respects your work' - this resonates with the anti-hustle, quality-over-quantity zeitgeist."

        feedback: "Excellent hook with specific insider knowledge (green room). Question format invites engagement. Perfectly on-brand - Myla as peer/guide sharing festival experience. Highly relevant to creators obsessing over follower counts. Authentic and warm."
      - reviewer: "critic"
        score: 8.0
        feedback: "Hook delivers genuine curiosity with concrete stakes (10k vs 100k followers). Green room detail is specific. The insight about peer respect is valuable and less obvious than typical creator advice. Execution is clean - no buzzwords, no cringe. This actually works."

    title: "The night I deleted 200 perfectly good tracks"
    hook: "I spent three years building a library of 'crowd pleasers.' Then I played a set that felt like lying, and everything changed."
    angle: "Building influence starts with brutal honesty about what you actually love - the moment I stopped curating for imaginary audiences and started sharing what moved ME, people finally started listening"
    rationale: "This captures the emotional turning point every creator faces: the tension between what you think will work and what's authentic. It's the lived experience behind 'find your voice' advice - the specific moment of transformation that people can relate to."

        feedback: "Powerful hook with specific stakes (200 tracks, felt like lying). Story format suits Myla's reflective nature perfectly. Vulnerable and authentic without being pretentious. Highly relatable emotional arc for creators. This is peak Myla voice."
      - reviewer: "critic"
        score: 6.5
        feedback: "The 'felt like lying' hook is emotionally sharp and the 200 tracks number adds stakes. But this is another authenticity sermon wrapped in a story. 'What moved ME' and 'people finally started listening' is the same tired creator narrative we've seen a thousand times. The transformation arc is predictable. Needs more specific detail about WHAT changed or HOW it worked to avoid being generic inspirational content."

    title: "My first brand deal almost killed my credibility"
    hook: "A gear company offered me $2k to post about their MIDI controller. I said yes. My audience said 'who even are you?'"
    angle: "Monetization isn't the goal - it's a side effect of trust. The creators who build sustainable influence turn down opportunities that don't align, even when they need the money"
    rationale: "Everyone teaching 'how to become an influencer' focuses on getting brand deals. This flips it - showing the mistake of prioritizing money over audience trust. It's the cautionary tale that makes the lesson stick through emotional stakes."

        feedback: "Compelling hook with real stakes ($2k, audience backlash). Lesson is authentic and anti-hustle. Fits Myla's reflective style. Highly relevant for creators chasing monetization. Minor note: 'almost killed' is slightly dramatic for her understated voice."
      - reviewer: "critic"
        score: 7.0
        feedback: "Hook has concrete stakes ($2k, MIDI controller, audience pushback). The 'trust over money' lesson is valuable. But 'monetization is a side effect' has become influencer wisdom cliché at this point. The story structure works but the insight is slightly derivative of the broader 'stay authentic' narrative. Still solid - just not groundbreaking."

    title: "The DM that made me realize I'd made it"
    hook: "It wasn't from a label or festival booker. It was from someone saying my mix helped them through their dad's funeral."
    angle: "Real influence isn't about reach or revenue - it's about the depth of impact on individual lives. When you focus on meaning over metrics, the metrics eventually follow"
    rationale: "This creates emotional connection by showing what success actually feels like for a creator. It humanizes the influencer journey and grounds abstract 'authenticity' advice in a specific, moving moment that shifts perspective."

        feedback: "Exceptional hook that immediately reframes success. Deeply emotional without being manipulative. Perfect embodiment of Myla's warm, authentic voice. Highly relevant counter-narrative to vanity metrics. This is exactly what she would say and how she'd say it."
      - reviewer: "critic"
        score: 8.5
        feedback: "The funeral DM hook is genuinely moving and specific enough to feel real, not manufactured. The reframe from labels/bookers to human impact is effective. 'Meaning over metrics' is familiar territory but the execution elevates it. The phrase 'the metrics eventually follow' is slightly self-help-y but the emotional core is strong enough to carry it. This works."
